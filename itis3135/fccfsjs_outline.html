      <h3>Personal Schedule & Commitment</h3>
      <p>
        I plan to complete the FreeCodeCamp Full Stack JavaScript section within four weeks, focusing on weekdays only.
        Each topic above represents my planned daily progress. I understand this is one continuous assignment rather
        than separate parts, and I take full responsibility for maintaining steady progress and completing the course
        on schedule.
