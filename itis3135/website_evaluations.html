                <a href="https://www.cameronsworld.net" target="_blank"><h3>cameronsworld</h3></a>
                <p>This is a personal website for Cameron, a digital artist and animator. The site 
                    has a fun and quirky design that reflects Cameron's artistic style, but
                also is a good example for bad design principles according to CRAP.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="list-header">Contrast</span>
                    <p>
                        The site uses a variety of colors and fonts, which can make it difficult to read and navigate. 
                        The text is often small and hard to read, and the color scheme can be overwhelming.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="list-header">Repitition</span>
                    <p>
                        The site lacks consistency in its design elements, such as font choices and color schemes. 
                        This can make it feel disjointed and unprofessional.  
                    </p>

                    <li><span class="list-header">Alignment</span>
                    <p>
                        The site has a lot of different sections and elements that are not aligned properly. 
                        This can make it feel cluttered and overwhelming.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="list-header">Proximity</span>
                    <p>
                        The site has a lot of different sections and elements that are not grouped together properly. 
                        This can make it difficult to find the information you are looking for.

                <p>Nike's official website (nike.com) serves as a dynamic online platform that seamlessly 
                    blends e-commerce with brand storytelling. It showcases a diverse range of athletic 
                    footwear, apparel, and accessories, catering to various sports and lifestyle needs. 
                    The site features immersive visuals, interactive elements, and personalized experiences 
                    to engage users and enhance their shopping journey.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="list-header">Contrast</span>
                    <p>
                        Nike's website employs a high-contrast color scheme, utilizing bold visuals 
                        and vibrant product images against clean, neutral backgrounds. This design choice 
                        not only highlights the products but also ensures readability and visual appeal 
                        across different devices and screen sizes. 
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="list-header">Repitition</span>
                    <p>
                        Consistency is evident throughout the site, with uniform typography, color palettes, 
                        and layout structures. This repetition reinforces Nike's brand identity and provides 
                        users with a cohesive and predictable navigation experience, making it easier to 
                        explore products and information.

                    </li>
                    <li><span class="list-header">Alignment</span>
                    <p>
                        The website's content is meticulously aligned, employing grid systems and structured 
                        layouts that guide the user's eye naturally across the page. This alignment enhances 
                        the overall aesthetic and usability, ensuring that information is presented in an 
                        organized and accessible manner.

                    <li><span class="list-header">Proximity</span>
                    <p>
                        Related content and products are grouped together thoughtfully, facilitating intuitive 
                        navigation. For instance, product details, reviews, and related items are positioned 
                        close to each other, allowing users to find relevant information quickly and make informed 
                        purchasing decisions.
