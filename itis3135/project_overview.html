        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>This website is being developed for an auto detailing business owned and operated by my brother. The purpose
            of the website is to introduce potential customers to the company, showcasing the quality of services and
            helping establish professional credibility through a well-designed online presence. The website will allow
            users to browse available detailing packages and pricing, view examples of previous work, and easily get in
            touch for inquiries or bookings.</p>

        <p>The intended users of the website are vehicle owners seeking professional detailing services. Whether they
            need basic cleaning, extensive restoration, or specialty treatments, this platform will serve as a
            convenient resource for learning about the business, exploring options, and contacting the owner directly.

        <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
        <p>On the Gallery page, JavaScript will let users hover over images to show small captions or additional
            details. On the Services and Gallery pages, small interactive feedback will appear when hovering over images
            or buttons, such as highlighting a “Most popular!” service. Additionally, fade-in effects will be used on
            scroll so content like service descriptions and gallery images gradually appear as the user moves down the
            page. These features are simple to implement and make the site feel more dynamic and engaging.</p>
